## Introduction

These are python files for a chat program between one or more clients on a server

Python must be installed and configured

## Initialize

### Party 1
We have in a first time the `client.py` and `server.py` files it's the most basic form for a chat between a client and a server <br />
execute the two commands in diff terminal :
```
$ py server.py
$ py client.py
```

### Party 2
Then the `client_E_R.py` and `serveur_many.py` files will be used to put several clients on the same server <br />
The clients will be able to communicate with each other <br />
execute the commands in diff terminal :
```
# server
$ py serveur_many.py

# client 1
$ py client_E_R.py

# client 2
$ py client_E_R.py
```

The last file is the same `client_E_R.py` file as before but in java format, it is not yet functional
