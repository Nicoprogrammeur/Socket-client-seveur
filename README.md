## Introduction

These are python files for a chat program between one or more clients on a server

Python must be installed and configured

## Initialize
We have in a first time the `client.py` and `server.py` files it's the most basic form for a chat between a client and a server

Then the `client_E_R.py` and `server_many.py` files will be used to put several clients on the same server <br />
The clients will be able to communicate with each other

The last file is the same `client_E_R.py` file as before but in java format, it is not yet functional
